WordPress Zero Spam makes blocking spammers a cinch. Install, activate and enjoy a spam-free site &mdash; with third-party plugin support.

Why force users to prove that they're humans by filling out captchas? Let bots prove they're not bots with the [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://benmarshall.me/wordpress-zero-spam/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam).
