== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WordPress Zero Spam check Ninja Forms submissions? =

No. As of v4.10.0, WordPress Zero Spam no longer checks Ninja Form submissions. Support was dropped due its [required of JavaScript](https://developer.ninjaforms.com/codex/loading-the-form-via-ajax/) and how it submits forms. JavaScript is one of the techniques WordPress Zero Spam uses to determine if a submission is spam. Ninja Forms employs a similar method and has its own [spam detection](https://ninjaforms.com/blog/spam-wordpress-form/) feature.

= Does WordPress Zero Spam check Jetpack comments? =

No. WordPress Zero Spam is unable to integrate Jetpack. For more information, see [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments).

= Spam coments are still getting through, help! =

WordPress Zero Spam relies on the default core form id (`#commentform`) in order to check comment submissions. Verify your comment forms have this ID or add the class `wpzerospam` to enable it on your site.

= All registrations are marked as spam, help! =

This is most likely due to a plugin or theme overriding the default markup of the registration form. Verify the form has an id of `registerform` or add the `wpzerospam` class to it.

Example with `registerform` id:

`<form name="registerform" id="registerform" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

Example with `wpzerospam` class:

`<form name="registerform" class="wpzerospam" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

If you need help, please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://benmarshall.me/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam).

= How do I integrate this into another plugin or theme? =

It's easy as adding the class `wpzerospam` to the `form` element, then adding a check in the form processor that the `wpzerospam_key` post value matches the option value in the database using the `wpzerospam_key_check()` helper function. See the [plugin's documentation](https://benmarshall.me/wordpress-zero-spam/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam) for more information on available hooks & functions.

= Is JavaScript required to check form submissions? =

Yes. One of the many techniques WordPress Zero Spam employs requires JavaScript be enabled to work properly.
