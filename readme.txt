WordPress Zero Spam makes blocking spammers a cinch. Install, activate and enjoy a spam-free site &mdash; with third-party plugin support.

== Description ==

Why force users to prove that they're humans by filling out captchas? Let bots prove they're not bots with the [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://benmarshall.me/wordpress-zero-spam/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam).

WordPress Zero Spam blocks spam submissions including comments, registrations and more automatically without any config or setup. Just install, activate, and enjoy a spam-free site.

WordPress Zero Spam was initially built based on the work by [David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/wordpress-comment-spam).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't spammy comments being blocked? =

WordPress Zero Spam relies on the default core form id (`#commentform`) in order to detect comments. Verify your comment forms have this ID or add the class `wpzerospam` to them so the plugin knows to it should attempt to detect spam comments.

= How can I integrate this into a plugin, theme or custom form? =

It's easy as adding the class `wpzerospam` to the `form` element, then adding a check in the form processor that the `wpzerospam_key` post value matches the option value in the database using the `wpzerospam_key_check()` helper function.

= Why does my registration form think every submission is spam? =

This is most likely due to a plugin or theme overriding the default markup of the registration form. Verify the form has an id of `registerform` or add the `wpzerospam` class to it.

Example with `registerform` id:

`<form name="registerform" id="registerform" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

Example with `wpzerospam` class:

`<form name="registerform" class="wpzerospam" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

= Is JavaScript required for this plugin to work? =

Yes, that's what does the magic and keeps spam bots out.

= What action hooks are available? =

* `wpzerospam_comment_spam` - Fires when a spam comment is detected.
* `wpzerospam_registration_spam` - Fires when a spam registration is detected.
* `wpzerospam_cf7_spam` - Fires when a spam submission is made with a CF7 form.
* `wpzerospam_gform_spam` - Fires when a spam submission is made with a Gravity Form.
